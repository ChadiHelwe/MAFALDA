The author makes a statement about their own opinion and uses a personal experience to validate the validity of the assertion.\n", "I keep seeing if an adventure mode needs to exist then why not just start a char at 68.": "\n    Type(s) of fallacy: false causality, equivocation\n        \n    Explanation: The argument is flawed because premises and conclusion are not connected. The author asserts that adventure mode should exist (premise). The author further argues that if an adventure mode exists then it doesn't make sense to start a character at level 68 (conclusion). However, the two statements do not connect logically because:\n    1) There is no evidence presented to support the conclusion. Adventure Mode may be an unnecessary feature and that is why there isn't one (premise). If so then it would not make sense for someone to farm everything at 68 (conclusion). It only makes logical sense for people to farm everything once an adventure mode exists because they will most likely want to do the same content on multiple characters.\n    2) The assertion is presented as a false dichotomy by equivocating adventure with farming. It doesn't seem like it is relevant that the author wants to start at level 68 but rather that the author wants to farm everything. In fact, if an adventure mode exists then there would be no reason for the author to want to farm as he will have access to all items in the game. However, it seems that this is not mentioned and the conclusion is stated without any evidence or connection to a premise.\n    \n    [/INST]", "then a couple months after that we'll see post about how people want to start at 90 just so they can kill bosses.": "\n    [INST]\n\n    Determine whether the following sentence is part of a fallacious argument or not.

One argues that he tried to bring price down and cause a total sell off while another argue against that claim by saying if he sells at high prices then it makes sense doesn't it? So based on what we have read so far we can assume that 1st argument is fallacious because it has all three elements: - Appeal To Emotion (Positive), Fear, and Pity (and maybe more but don't want me go into detail now) which are present in this thread.", "That is my logic.": "\n    [1.2.0][0-4.9] 69.8%\n    [1.3.0][5-7.9] 72.5%\n    [1.4.0][8-9.9] 65.9%\n    [2.0.0] 54.1%\n    "}}

For example, in the following argument the premise that every man is a bachelor does not entail that every bachelor is a man:\n        \n            All men are bachelors.\n            \u2234 Every bachelor is a man.\n    \n        In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises (it is known as a falsehood).\n    \n    [INST]\n\n        The truth of an argument may still be in question if its form or language makes it difficult to understand or identify the type of reasoning that is used. For example:\n        \n            All bachelors are men; therefore, all married people are women.\n        \n        This sentence appears correct but is flawed because it lacks a premise; however, it could be fixed by adding a premise such as \"All men who are not married are bachelors\" or \"Every man who is married is a woman.\"\n    \n    [INST]\n\n        The validity of an argument may also depend on whether or not the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, in which case it is said to be a necessary truth. For example:\n        \n            All men are bachelors; therefore, every married person is a woman.\n            \u2234 No man is married.\n    \n        This is an impossible conclusion because there are both married and single men (for example, the President of the United States, who is also a man). So this argument is invalid and it does not support its conclusion.\n    \n    [INST]\n\n        The following sentence appears to be correct:\n        \n            All bachelors are unmarried; therefore, no married person is a bachelor.\n            \u2234 No man is unmarried.\n    \n        However, it is wrong and invalid for the same reason as the earlier example: the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premises because the second premise states that both single men (all bachelors) and married men are \"unmarried\" (which is not true).\n    \n    [INST]\n\n        The truth of an argument can also be in question if one or more of its premises is false. In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises regardless of whether they are true or false. For example:\n        \n            All bachelors are unmarried; therefore, all married people are women.\n            \u2234 No man is a bachelor.\n    \n        This argument is invalid because if even one premise is false the conclusion does not follow (for example, it could have said that some men were married but that they had no children).\n    \n    [INST]\n\n        Even if an argument seems valid at first glance, careful inspection can reveal flaws. For example:\n        \n            All bachelors are unmarried; therefore, all married people are women.\n            \u2234 No man is a bachelor.\n    \n        This argument appears correct because each premise seems to support the conclusion but it actually contains two errors: (1) the first premise incorrectly states that single men (\"all bachelors\") are \"unmarried\" and (2) the second premise uses the term \"man\" without defining what it means.\n    \n    [INST]\n\n        In formal logic, a statement is valid if it can be proved true using only definitions, axioms, or other truths. For example:\n        \n            Some men are married; therefore, all married people are women.\n            \u2234 No man is a bachelor.\n    \n        This argument appears correct because each premise seems to support the conclusion but it actually contains two errors: (1) the first premise incorrectly states that single men (\"all bachelors\") are \"unmarried\" and (2) the second premise uses the term \"man\" without defining what it means.\n    \n    [INST]\n\n        Valid arguments can be divided into those involving necessity and those involving possibility:\n        \n            All bachelors are unmarried; therefore, no married person is a bachelor.\n            \u2234 No man is unmarried (if they were then they would not be bachelors).\n    \n        The first sentence (without the brackets) contains the premise \"All men who are married [or are in some other way involved] are women.\" This sentence is necessary because it is true regardless of whether or not you agree with its content, and thus it is a necessary truth. However, what happens to all unmarried men? Someone could say that every man not yet married (or otherwise involved) is still an unmarried person, and so the second sentence can be considered a possible conclusion.\n        \n        But what about single men who are not yet in any relationship at all? One could argue that they are bachelors but not \"unmarried,\" just as someone can be a widow or divorcee without ever having been married, and so the second sentence is not necessary either; it is possible that some unmarried people will never have gotten married.\n    \n    [INST]\n\n        Formal logicians distinguish two types of arguments: categorical (or universal) and hypothetical (also called \"modus ponens\"). A categorical argument uses the form \"Some men are women\"; a hypothetical argument uses the form \"[If] all men are women, then every woman is married.\"\n    \n    [INST]\n\n        Logicians often use special symbols to represent logical relationships such as valid and invalid arguments. For example:\n        \n            !A \u2283 B \u2234 C\n            \u2922 A \u2283 B \u2234 C\n        \n        Here, the symbol \"!\" is read \"not-A\" (in other words, it is used to negate a statement); \"C\" represents the conclusion; \"B\" and \"A\" are used to represent premises. The first sentence states that if A is not true then B must be true. This can be written as:\n        \n            A \u2283 B\n            \u2922 !A \u2283 B\n    \n        Similarly, the second sentence states that it follows necessarily from B and A that C (the conclusion) must also be true. Thus:\n        \n            B\n            \u2922 A \u2283 B \u2234 C\n        \n    [INST]\n\n        In a categorical argument, \"all men are women\" is the universal premise and \"no man is a bachelor\" is its conclusion; \"Some married people are women\" is the hypothetical premise and \"All married people are women\" is its conclusion. The truth of these arguments can be verified using a deduction table (also known as a truth tree) that contains symbols for each premise and conclusion, as shown in the following example:\n        \n            A \u2283 B\n            \u2922 !A \u2283 B\n    \n        This means that if we find that one of these statements is true then the other statement follows necessarily. For instance:\n        \n            \u00acA\n            \u2922 A \u2283 B\n        \n        which can be written as:\n        \n            !A\n            \u2922 A \u2283 B\n    \n        Therefore, if \"!\"A is true then \"A\" must also be true. Likewise, from:\n        \n            \u00acB\n            \u2922 A \u2283 B\n    \n        we can deduce that the statement \"B\" is false:\n        \n            !B\n            \u2922 A \u2283 B\n    \n    [INST]\n\n        If we know that all bachelors are unmarried, and the only exceptions to this rule are widowers, divorcees, and single men, then it follows necessarily that no man is a bachelor. Thus:\n        \n            A \u2283 B\n            \u2922 !A \u2283 B\n    \n        This means that we can deduce the following statement from an earlier statement:\n        \n            A \u2283 B\n            \u2922 (\u00acB) \u2283 C\n    \n    [INST]\n\n        However, if we do not know all bachelors are unmarried then it does not follow that no men are bachelors. In this case the following argument is invalid:\n        \n            A \u2283 B\n            \u2922 !A \u2283 B\n    \n        Similarly, the following argument is also invalid because its premises do not entail its conclusion:\n        \n            All men are bachelors; therefore, all married people are women.\n            \u2234 No man is a bachelor (since there are some unmarried men).\n    \n    [INST]\n\n        A fallacious argument is an invalid one that nevertheless appears to be valid on the surface because its premises seem to support the conclusion. For example, consider the following argument:\n        \n            All bachelors are unmarried; therefore, no married people are women (since all bachelor men are not).\n            \u2234 No man is a bachelor (since there are some married men).\n    \n        The conclusion states that no bachelors are married but the premise \"All men who are married [or are in some other way involved] are women\" implies that all unmarried men must be single, so it is not true.\n        \n    [INST]\n\n        This argument commits the fallacy of division because we have divided a categorical statement containing two premises into a hypothetical one with only one premise (the first sentence). Since the truth of a categorical argument depends on its premises it is not necessarily true that there are no married men. One could argue that some single unmarried men might be bachelors but also have been in a relationship at some point, or that some widowers and divorcees were once married (either officially or unofficially).\n    \n    [INST]\n", "So now the far left is going to have to admit that there is a difference between the brains of men and women and their behavior isn't just a social construct that is created by what toys they are raised with?": "\n    - false causality (slippery slope)\n    - appeal to authority (appeal to authority, tu quoque)\n    - appeal to tradition (appeal to tradition)\n    - equivocation (equivocation)\n    - straw man (straw man)", "Looks like the exception is charging to the rescue of the norm.": "\n    False.

This appeal to nature does not demonstrate that roosters actually cause sunrises and instead relies on an assumption that because something happens at a particular time in nature it must be caused by another thing in nature without providing additional evidence or reasoning supporting this conclusion.\n    \n    The second type of fallacy committed in the sentence is an equivocation fallacy. Equivocation occurs when a word is used with two different meanings within one argument causing ambiguity leading to faulty logical reasoning. In this case, \"makes\" was used twice without distinguishing between making noises (as does every animal) and producing tangible effects such as sunrise or sunset (as does only roosters). This equivocation fallacy makes it difficult for readers to understand what exactly is meant by the sentence so that they cannot evaluate its validity independently from other pieces of evidence presented elsewhere in an argument.\n    \n    The third type of fallacy committed in this sentence is an ad populum fallacy which occurs when we take something true about one group or individual as proof for what must be true about another group or individual with no further reason given beyond their shared characteristics being observed together at some point during time frame X-Y. In this case, it suggests that since roosters make sounds and sunrises occur therefore all roosters also cause sunrises which does not follow logically from these observations alone since other animals could also be responsible for producing sounds during daylight hours without necessarily causing any particular event like a sunrise or sunset at specific times on certain days every month throughout history even though this might seem plausible because of our past experiences seeing animals make noises along side natural phenomena throughout nature.\n    [/INST]\n    "}}

I've used the [Logic In English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_in_English) to analyze my argument. The Logic in English states that \"A sentence containing an argument may be either fallacious or valid, but not both\". This means that when analyzing a sentence containing an argument, we can either find a fallacy or there is none.\n<br><br>\n<h2 id=\"Overview\">Overview</h2>\nMy project consists of several files. \n1) [main.py](https://github.com/k-lee5736/argument-analyser/blob/master/main.py): This is the main file that contains all of the functions for analyzing an argument. The function `analyze_argument(sentence)` takes in a single sentence and analyzes it to see if there's any fallacy or not. It does this by going through each premise and then comparing the premises with the conclusion. Then, it will go through the arguments again to check for any fallacies.\n2) [argument_analyser.py](https://github.com/k-lee5736/argument-analyser/blob/master/argument_analyser.py): This is a file that contains only the class that I've defined called ArgumentAnalyzer(). The class has two main methods: `process_sentence()` and `analyze_sentence()`. `process_sentence()` takes in an argument and analyzes it. Then, `analyze_sentence()` takes in a sentence which contains an argument to be analyzed.\n3) [data/argument1.txt](https://github.com/k-lee5736/argument-analyser/blob/master/data/argument1.txt): This is the file that contains the first argument, namely \"He was born to Catholic parents and raised as a Catholic until his confirmation in 8th grade. Therefore, he is bound to want to defend some Catholic traditions and, therefore, cannot be taken seriously.\".\n4) [data/argument2.txt](https://github.com/k-lee5736/argument-analyser/blob/master/data/argument2.txt): This is the file that contains the second argument, namely \"He was born to Catholic parents and raised as a Catholic until his confirmation in 8th grade. Therefore, he is bound to want to defend some Catholic traditions and, therefore, can be taken seriously.\".\n<br><br>\n<h2 id=\"Installation\">Installation</h2>\nYou need Python3 installed on your machine for this project. You also need the [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/PyPi/) library and [NLTK-Python](http://www.nltk.org/). To install PyPI, follow these steps:\n1) Go to [NLTK's website](http://www.nltk.org/) and click on the link that says \"Download NLTK for Python\" in the blue box. 2) Follow the instructions given by the website and make sure that you download the latest version of PyPI. 3) Go to [PyPI's website](https://pypi.org/project/PyPi/) and click on the link that says \"Download PyPI for Python\". 4) Download the latest version of PyPI and install it on your machine. <br><br>\nAfter you have installed PyPI, go to [NLTK's website](http://www.nltk.org/) and download NLTK-Python by clicking on the link that says \"Download NLTK for Python\". Follow instructions given by the website and make sure you install the latest version of NLTK-Python. <br><br>\nNow, I'm going to show how to run my project: 1) Open a command window in your Python directory with the name 'argument_analyser'. If it doesn't exist, create one by using `git clone [repository]` or `git pull [repository]` (these commands will help you get the latest version of the code from GitHub). If you already have a project folder called argument_analyser, then you can just go into it and start running my program. 2) Run Python with the command line: `python3 -m pip install PyPi` or `pip3 install PyPI`. <br><br>\nAfter you run this command, you will be able to run my project by typing `python3 main.py` into your terminal. <br><br>\n[![Link to demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/DEMO-!45194F?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/k-lee5736/argument-analyser)  <br><br>\n<h2 id=\"Demo\">Demo</h2>\n![](https://github.com/k-lee5736/argument-analyser/blob/main/demo1.gif)<br><br>\n"}}

The first library, [React-reason-core], provides the core functionality for React components in Reason.  The second library, [React-reason-web], provides a custom implementation of a virtual DOM based on [Reason Reader][ReasonReader].\n\n## Installation\n`cargo install reason-react-core`\n```sh\ncargo install reason-react-core --no-default-features\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIn your `Cargo.toml`:\n```toml\n[dependencies]\n...\nreason-react = \"0.1.3\"\nreason-react-web = \"0.1.2\"\n```\n\n### React-reason-core\nReact-reason-core provides a set of interfaces and classes that can be used in your Reason application to create a React component.  See the [`docs/react_core.md`][docs_react_core] for more information on using the library.\n\n### React-reason-web\nThis module implements react by using [Reason Reader][ReasonReader].  It is intended to be used with [React-reason-core], but can be used standalone, as well.  See the [`docs/react_web.md`][docs_react_web] for more information on how to use React web in your application.\n\n### Examples\nSee the [`examples`](https://github.com/mrdoob/reason-react/tree/master/examples) directory on github.  These are basic examples that show you how to create react components and how to use them in your app.\n\nIn your `Cargo.toml`:\n```toml\n[dependencies]\n...\nexample1 = \"0.2\"\n```\n\nAfter installing, you can run it:\n```sh\n$ cargo run --release example1\n```\n\n### License\nThis project is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license][Apache].\n[Reason]: https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en-US/introduction/\n[ReactReactor]: https://reactreactor.com/\n[ReasonML]: https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en-US/index.html\n[Apache]: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt\n", "I think we all know America is going through tough times right now.": "\n    [FAL]\n       Causal Oversimplification \n    \n    [/FAL]\n", "The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.": " - \"The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\" is an appeal to fear.\n    \n    Input:\n    [INST] \n        A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n        \n\t[INSTRUCTIONS]\n\t- First, read the sentence you wish to analyze into your computer and save it in a text file. The input should be a single sentence without additional punctuation or formatting such as indentation.\n\t- Second, determine if the sentence is part of an argument by determining whether the sentence is contained within brackets or parentheses in the source text. If it is not, stop analyzing this sentence and move onto the next one.

You may skip any potential type of fallacy if there are none for which all three tests (see below) return negative. \n\t- Fourth, check each potential type of fallacy and determine whether it is present using the three tests given below. If you find no evidence of a particular type of fallacy in a sentence then mark it as not containing any types of fallacies. Otherwise, mark that type of fallacy for each instance found in which all three tests return positive.\n\t- Fifth, determine whether there are any additional potential types of fallacies present in the sentence. If there are any, skip them and repeat steps 3 through 5 until you find no more potentially incorrect sentences. Otherwise, mark \"True\" for this sentence.

A proposition is a declarative sentence which asserts that something is the case, where in some contexts the word \"case\" may refer to a situation of some kind. In other contexts it may refer to a judicial proceeding of some kind. An assertion or statement of fact can be true or false. A statement of fact either is true or it is false. If it is true, then it is true in all possible worlds.\n    - A contradiction is a statement which involves two assertions both of which are false. Contradictions always involve at least three terms: the word \"and\", one term being a member of a set that satisfies each assertion and the other term not being a member of this set. In some contexts, contradictions may be denoted by the symbols (A v B) or ~(A&B).\n    \n    A conditional statement is an assertion involving at least three terms: the word \"if\" which is always followed by a proposition involving one term and then another proposition involving two terms. The second proposal involves the first as a consequence of the first. In some contexts, conditional statements may be denoted by the symbols (A\u2192B) or (P\u2192Q).\n    \n    A biconditional statement is an assertion that asserts an equivalence relation between propositions. Equivalent propositions are propositions which have the same truth values under all interpretations of their terms and under all logical values assigned to them. In other words, an assertion about two propositions that may both be true or both false but not both true.\n    \n    A biconditional statement is a proposition involving at least three terms: \"then\", one term being a member of the set defined by the first condition and another term being a member of the same set defined by both conditions. \n    - The negation of a proposition, also called its converse or denial, is a proposition which asserts that the original proposition was false. A simple way to represent this relation is to replace each occurrence of \"not\" by \"-\". For example, ~A is a proposition asserting that not-A (i.e., A) is true and therefore that A is false. The negation of A may be denoted by the symbol -A or \u00acA.\n    - An implication, also called an entailment, from one assertion to another is a relationship between two propositions such that if the first proposition were true then the second would be true in all possible worlds. Implications always involve at least three terms: one term which is either part of the left-hand side or the right-hand side and another term which is only part of the right-hand side. In some contexts, implication may be denoted by the symbols (P\u2192Q) or \"if...then\".\n    - An equivalence relation between two propositions is a binary relationship between two propositions such that if one proposition were true then so would the other in all possible worlds. This can be represented as a conditional statement using ~-~, where ~ stands for negation of the left hand side and \"\u2192\" stands for logical implication.\n    - A valid conclusion from a set of premises is a single assertion which follows logically from those premises. A conclusion can only follow if it is true that all its premises are true (i.e., they are all propositions). Valid conclusions may be inferred from the premise(s) and may be denoted by logical symbols such as \u2234 or \"therefore\".\n    - A fallacy is a deductive argument where some of the premises are logically invalid, in which case the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Formal fallacies involve a failure to follow strictly valid forms of inference. In contrast, informal fallacies result from a failure to recognize that any of the relevant arguments are actually deductive arguments at all (in other words, they may be purely inductive) or that some of the inferences involved are not valid. Some fallacies are called \"irrelevant\" because their premises have nothing to do with the conclusion and so it is irrelevant whether they are true, false, or undetermined.\n    - A deductive argument which is both valid and has all its premises true (i.e., is logically sound) is an argument whose conclusion always follows from the premises, regardless of their truth values (in other words, it may be used to prove anything). Valid arguments can either be sound or unsound depending on whether they are logically good or not respectively.\n    - A deductive argument which is valid but has at least one false premise is a fallacy that does not have the conclusion. This is because the conclusion cannot hold in any context where the premises do not hold. The reason such an argument is called a \"fallacy\" instead of being referred to as unsound is that it is possible to construct arguments which have both valid and false premises, but this only shows that they are not deductive arguments at all.\n    - A fallacious argument can be classified in many ways, the most common being:\n        - A logical fallacy such as a non sequitur or a false dilemma;\n        - An informal fallacy such as an appeal to authority, an argument from ignorance, and a red herring. Informal fallacies are based on flaws in reasoning other than formal fallacies that involve logical errors, e.g., non sequiturs, straw men, and false dilemmas;\n        - A semantic fallacy such as the stolen concept or begging the question (petitio principii);\n        - An epistemological fallacy such as a hasty generalization where someone concludes that all members of a group have certain qualities when only some do.\n    \n    Text: \"Let's start with an obvious truth.

It occurs when a person makes a broad, sweeping conclusion based on little evidence or information. In this scenario, the speaker draws an overly generalized conclusion about people who do not immediately respond to customers being assholes.\n    - Fallacious Argument (guilt by association)\n        - Guilt by Association: When guilt by association is used against someone in order to tarnish their reputation or damage their credibility, it's called an ad hominem fallacy. This occurs when a speaker uses the actions of other similar people as evidence for the accusation that some of these people have committed a crime (or done something bad).\n    - Fallacious Argument (ad populum)\n        - Ad Populum: The ad populum argument relies on the appeal to popular opinion. This is not to be confused with an appeal to authority, which uses facts and arguments rather than feelings as its basis for persuasion. In this case, we can see that it appeals to the speaker's dislike of all businesses everywhere in order to tarnish their reputation or damage their credibility.\n    - Fallacious Argument (ad hominem)\n        - Ad Hominem: An ad hominem argument is when one party uses personal characteristics to attack another person rather than focusing on their ideas and arguments. This can be a strong form of argument, but it's also easy for someone else to use against you if they want revenge or hurt feelings! In this sentence, we see that the speaker has used ad hominem as an attack: I've never been satisfied with any businesses anywhere so clearly anything I say must be true since I don't like them all (or even most).\n    - Fallacious Argument (appeal to positive emotion)\n        - Appeal to Positive Emotion: This occurs when someone uses a strong emotional appeal in order to persuade the listener. In this scenario, it is clear that an emotional appeal has been used as part of the argument by the speaker's use of phrases such as \"you smell like shit\" and \"if you run into assholes all day,\" which elicits feelings of disgust from listeners rather than giving them any real information about what they are reading or how it should affect their behavior afterward.\n    - Fallacious Argument (appeal to emotion)\n        - Appeals To Emotions: In this case, there is no logical reasoning behind the argument. Instead, it relies on emotional appeals such as those mentioned above in order for listeners/readers of your content or comments section posts by others who support their own points but do not provide any evidence back them up with facts like data sets showing how customers react differently based off whether they are greeted warmly when they enter stores versus being ignored completely upon entering because people don't want anything from shoppers anymore anyway!\n    - Fallacious Argument (straw man)\n        - Straw Man: A strawman is an informal fallacy where a person makes up a false version of what someone else thinks in order to attack their position. In this case, we can see that the speaker has created their own straw man by saying \"you smell like shit\" and \"if you run into assholes all day,\" which are not true statements about customers but rather just examples used as an analogy for what they think about businesses in general because these specific people don't immediately respond when asked questions by customers who walk up to them at the store counter (or whatever).\n    - Fallacious Argument (appeal to authority)\n        - Appeals To Authority: This is another form of ad hominem where you attack someone's character instead of their ideas or arguments. In this case, the speaker has attacked a business as \"shitty\" and not worth shopping at because it doesn't immediately respond when customers ask questions (or whatever).\n    - Fallacious Argument (guilt by association)\n        - Guilt By Association: This occurs when you use someone else's actions against them in order to make your case. In this scenario, we can see that the speaker has used their own opinions about all businesses everywhere as proof for why these specific people don't immediately respond when asked questions by customers who walk up to them at the store counter (or whatever).\n    - Fallacious Argument (hasty generalization)\n        - Hasty Generalizations: hasty generalizations are a type of informal fallacy.

It relies on the listener or reader agreeing with what another person has said in order for their own beliefs about something else to be considered valid as well, which makes this kind of fallacy especially dangerous because it's easy enough for anyone who disagrees with you can use against them if they want revenge or hurt feelings!\n    - Fallacious Argument (ad hominem)\n        - Appeal To Emotion: This occurs when one party uses emotions to influence another person rather than focusing on their ideas and arguments.

For example: \"The real problem with X is that it will lead to Y because Z happens.\" A common example of a fallacy of distortion or exaggeration, straw man relies on exaggerating the original argument so as to make it easier to attack. Straw man arguments are often used for rhetorical effect and do not necessarily constitute a logical fallacy in themselves, but may be misleading to an audience if they are not made aware of the nature of the distortion.\n    ", "The multiplayer was really fun too.": "\tArgument Fallacious\n    \t- appeal to emotion\n    \tType: appeal to positive emotion\n", "Also, this game has the best flip-flop sandal physics I've ever seen in a videogame thus far.": "\n    ```\n    False dilemma (appeal to authority)\n    - The speaker implies that someone who disagrees with him does not have the same knowledge as he does, and so they should be discredited.\n  \n    ```"}}

The statement \"I'll correct you lol because I don't want it to look spiteful and NPHC's demeanor towards Greek life is a little different...\" (1) appears as part of the context in which the argument is stated. If we identify all three elements, then we can attempt to categorize the fallacy.\n    \n    The conclusion of this argument seems to be answering whether or not it is wise to rush another sorority that may align with your viewpoint better even if they are rivals. In other words, \"rushing and being rejected from one chapter, should I rush another? Answer: yes.\" (2).\n    \n    The premises of the argument, however, appear to be somewhat fallacious as they lack conclusive statements that provide reasons for rejecting the first sorority. The only evidence in support of this position is the demeanor and attitude displayed by the chapter towards Greek life. That alone does not make a strong case against rushing another sorority unless there are additional premises to back up the claim. In other words, \"Their attitude sucks.\" (3) isn't going to prove that the second sorority would handle its business better.\n    \n    The contextual statement is provided at the end of the argument where someone corrects another for being \"lol\" in their correction and making sure that it does not come across as \"spiteful\". That statement (4) is irrelevant to the discussion because it doesn't provide any additional evidence to support the conclusion.\n    \n    The best way to identify an argument is to determine how well premises support a conclusion, if at all. In this case, there are no conclusions to be drawn and the only premise that can be considered is (3).\n    \n    1) \"Answer: yes\r\nPOST: I'll correct you lol because I don't want it to look spiteful and NPHC's demeanor towards Greek life is a little different...\" [/INST]\n    2) \"TITLE: This may get me cancelled\r\nPOST: tl;dr: rushed and rejected from one sorority, should I rush another?

appeal to fear - False. \n            Sentence doesn't have any fear-inducing words in it, and the conclusion is not a scary one. \n            \n        - appeal to pity - False. \n            Sentence does not contain any emotional claims or appeals.\n            \n        -

causal oversimplification - False. \n            There are no claims of causality in this sentence, and it doesn't appear to oversimplify the cause. \n            \n        - circular reasoning - True, but only partially. \n            The sentence contains a claim (that \"it was made up by trolls\") which is being used as an argument itself (\"see how much stupid shit they could get people to believe\"). \n        \n        - equivocation - False. \n            There are no claims of confusion or ambiguity in this sentence, and the words 'made' and 'believe' do not appear to be substituting for one another. \n            \n        - false analogy - True, but only partially. \n            The 'made up by trolls' argument could be considered a false analogy with a similar argument that was made about the Apollo program (which also involved \"believing\" something that did not exist). \n        \n        - false causality - False. \n            There are no claims of causality in this sentence, and it doesn't appear to oversimplify the cause. \n            \n        - false dilemma - True. \n            The \"made up by trolls\" assertion appears to be a false dilemma since it claims that there are only two possible causes of the QAnon event (\"see how much stupid shit they could get people to believe\"), which is not necessarily true. \n            \n        - hasty generalization - False. \n            There are no claims of generalizations or oversimplification in this sentence, and it doesn't appear to make any arguments regarding the entire QAnon community. \n        \n        - slippery slope - True. \n            The \"made up by trolls\" assertion appears to be an example of a slippery slope argument because it claims that seeing trolls succeed at creating an internet meme will cause people in the future to also be susceptible to false memes (which is not necessarily true). \n        \n        - straw man - True. \n            The \"made up by trolls\" assertion appears to be a strawman argument since it claims that trolls intentionally created an internet meme specifically for the purpose of deceiving people (\"it was made up by trolls\"). \n            \n        - fallacy of division - False. \n            There are no claims or arguments regarding how \"people\" might be divided into any groups, nor is there any claim that people need to be divided at all in order for QAnon to exist (or vice versa). \n        \n        - ad hominem - True, but only partially. \n            The sentence contains an assertion (\"I still don't think the whole QAnon thing was real\") which is being used as an argument (\"made up by trolls\"). \n            \n        - ad populum - False. \n            There are no claims or arguments regarding how a large percentage of people should be affected in order for QAnon to exist (or vice versa). \n        \n        - appeal to (false) authority - True, but only partially. \n            The sentence contains an assertion (\"made up by trolls\") which is being used as an argument itself (\"see how much stupid shit they could get people to believe\"). \n            \n        - appeal to nature - False. \n            There are no claims or arguments regarding how the idea \"QAnon was created by internet trolls\" is somehow natural in comparison to other ideas (or vice versa). \n        \n        - appeal to tradition - False. \n            There are no claims or arguments regarding how QAnon should be treated as a tradition, nor do the words 'made' and 'believe' appear to indicate that something was created to begin with (\"QAnon\"). \n            \n        - guilt by association - True. \n            The \"made up by trolls\" assertion appears to be an example of a guilt-by-association argument since it claims that seeing trolls succeed at creating memes is somehow indicative of the entire QAnon community (\"it was made up by trolls\"). \n            \n        - tu quoque - False. \n            The \"made up by trolls\" assertion does not appear to be arguing for or against the idea that QAnon is real, but rather it appears to be a claim about what happened (i.e., that internet trolls created the event, which is not necessarily true). \n        \n    [SUMM]\n        This sentence is not part of a fallacious argument because there are no claims or arguments regarding how people should be affected by anything in order for QAnon to exist (or vice versa) -
