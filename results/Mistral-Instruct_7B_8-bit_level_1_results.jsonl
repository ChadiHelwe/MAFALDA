The type(s) of fallacy used are appeal to emotion and fallacy of credibility. \n    \n    Explanation: \n       \n    - Appeal to emotion: The use of the phrase \"just lose weight\" elicits an emotional response, rather than providing evidence or logical reasoning for why young people with disabilities or conditions that disqualify them should join the military. \n       \n    - Fallacy of credibility: The statement that \"every organization needs desk jockeys\" is a false assumption and may not be true in all cases.
