This is an appeal to worse problems, which suggests that the problem being discussed is the most significant one and therefore rejects any solution that does not address it directly.

By asking about clerical jobs in the army, the speaker is suggesting that joining the military may be a viable option for people with disabilities or conditions that disqualify them from other jobs.

This argument is flawed because it assumes that all disqualifying issues are equal in severity and that joining the military is the only option for people with disabilities or conditions that disqualify them from certain jobs.
