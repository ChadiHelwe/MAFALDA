POST: This is a ridiculous post and this mechanic will never be changed. Seat switching has always been a BF mechanic. Dont sit here and try and talk about realism or how you shouldnt be able to swap instantly between seats when there is hardly anything realistic about BF vehicle play in general. Sounds like you need to get better if you are having trouble shooting down the most vulnerable aircraft in the sky.\n", "prediction": {"TITLE: What would people think about preventing people from switching out from a pilot seat?": "\n    No fallacy detected. The sentence is a simple question seeking information or opinion.", "i.e. to a gunner position; you'd still be able to bail.": "\n    Fallacy type(s): appeal to (false) authority and/or fallacy of division \n        \n    Explanation: The sentence \"i.e. to a gunner position; you'd still be able to bail\" is not part of a fallacious argument. It is a simple statement that provides additional information about the mechanic of seat switching in Battlefield. However, the text in which it is embedded contains several fallacies, such as appeal to authority and fallacy of division. The sentence \"This is a ridiculous post and this mechanic will never be changed\" appeals to authority by suggesting that the argument is absurd and cannot be true because it goes against established norms or conventions. The sentence also uses the fallacy of division by assuming that the mechanic must be false because there are \"hardly anything realistic about BF vehicle play in general,\" which is not a valid inference from the evidence presented.", "POST:": "\n    The sentence \"POST:\" is not part of a fallacious argument.", "This is a ridiculous post and this mechanic will never be changed.": "\n    The sentence is not part of a fallacious argument.", "Seat switching has always been a BF mechanic.": "\n    The sentence is not part of a fallacious argument.", "Dont sit here and try and talk about realism or how you shouldnt be able to swap instantly between seats when there is hardly anything realistic about BF vehicle play in general.": "\n    The given sentence is not part of a fallacious argument.", "Sounds like you need to get better if you are having trouble shooting down the most vulnerable aircraft in the sky.": "\n    There is no fallacious argument in the given sentence."}}
