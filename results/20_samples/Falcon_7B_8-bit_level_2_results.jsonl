The argument is fallacious because the conclusion is not established by the premises. The conclusion is \"Once they wear masks your anxiety will force you to demand the next step\", but the premises are \"The masks do little\", \"They often need to touch or grapple\", and \"Your anxiety will force you to demand the next step\".\n    \n    The conclusion of the argument is not established by the premises. There are no reasons or arguments presented in the premises that support the conclusion.\n    \n    Therefore, the conclusion is a non-sequitur.\n\n## Fallacious Argument 2: Appeal to worst problems\n    \n    [INST]\n\n    Arguments are fallacious if they appeal to the worst possible outcomes.\n    \n    1. Premise: \"The police officer had to quarantine himself at home, because he tested positive for COVID-19.\"\n    2. Premise: \"It is very unlikely that he will infect anyone at the checkpoint.\"\n    \n    Conclusion: \"No need for police to wear masks at checkpoints.\"\n\n    Output:\n    \"Correct.\" [/INST]\n    \n    Explanation:\n    The argument is fallacious because the conclusion is not established by the premises.\n    \n    The premises of the argument establish that the police officer had to quarantine himself because he tested positive for COVID-19.\n    \n    The conclusion that \"No need for police to wear masks at checkpoints\" is not established by the premises because there are no arguments or reasons in the premises that support the conclusion.\n    \n    Therefore, the argument is fallacious.\n\n## Fallacious Argument 3: False dilemma\n    1. Premise: \"Either the police officer will infect everyone or no one will get infected.\"\n    2. Conclusion: \"It is very unlikely that he will infect anyone at the checkpoint.\"\n    \n    Output:\n    \"Correct.\" [/INST]\n    \n    Explanation:\n    The argument is fallacious because the conclusion is not established by the premises.\n    \n    The premises of the argument establish that either the police officer will infect everyone or no one will get infected.\n    \n    The conclusion \"It is very unlikely that he will infect anyone at the checkpoint\" is not established by the premises.\n    \n    Therefore, the argument is fallacious.\n\n## Fallacious Argument 4: Hasty Generalization\n    1. Premise: \"Some police officers have tested positive for COVID-19.\"\n    2.

Appeal to (false) authority : (NFL is a national organization). The conclusion is that \"NFL is a national organization\", which is true. However, \"NFL is a national organization\" is not an argument for \"NFL is therefore allowed by federal law.\" It is sufficient to show that NFL is a national organization, but that does not establish that it is allowed by federal law. So this is an attempt to establish the conclusion by claiming it is true, which is a fallacy.\n    2. Appeal to emotion : \"NFL is a national organization\". The conclusion is that \"NFL is a national organization\". The claim being made is that NFL is a national organization, and it is true. However, an appeal to emotion is an attempt to establish the conclusion as a premise. This is an appeal to emotion.\n    3. Straw man : \"NFL is a national organization\". The conclusion is that \"NFL is therefore allowed by federal law\". However, the argument is not stating that NFL is a federal organization (which it is not). The argument is instead arguing that \"NFL is a national organization\", and that being a national organization implies that it is allowed by federal law. But the conclusion is not that \"NFL is therefore allowed by federal law\", it is that \"NFL is a national organization\". So this is a straw man attempt to state the conclusion, since the argument is not attempting to do so.\n    4. Appeal to division : \"NFL is a national organization\". The conclusion is that \"NFL is a national organization\". The argument is attempting to establish that \"NFL is a national organization\". However, it is only establishing that \"NFL is a national organization\". The argument is not attempting to establish that \"NFL is a national organization, and since it is a national organization it is allowed by federal law\". So, in order to establish the conclusion the argument is required to establish that \"NFL is allowed by federal law\". This is an appeal to division.\n    5. False dilemma : \"NFL is a national organization\". The conclusion is that \"NFL is a national organization\". \"NFL is a national organization\", and \"NFL is allowed by federal law\" are two premises that lead to the conclusion. Since the conclusion is true, it is not established that it is false to conclude that \"NFL is a national organization\". So this is an attempt to establish the conclusion as false, when it is not.\n    6. Appeal to worse problems : \"NFL is a national organization\". The conclusion is that \"NFL is a national organization\". The argument is claiming that \"NFL is a national organization\", and \"NFL is not allowed by federal law\". Since the argument is attempting to establish that \"NFL is a national organization\" and it is true, it is not established that it is false to conclude that \"NFL is not allowed by federal law\". So this is an attempt to establish the conclusion as false, when it is not.\n    7. Appeal to pity : \"NFL is a national organization\". The conclusion is that \"NFL is a national organization\". The argument is attempting to establish that \"NFL is a national organization\". Since the argument is not establishing that \"NFL is a national organization\" and true, it is not established that the argument is an attempt to establish that it is false to conclude that \"NFL is not allowed by federal law\". So this is an attempt to establish the conclusion as false, when it is not.\n    8. False analogy : \"NFL is a national organization\". The conclusion is that \"NFL is a national organization\". The argument is attempting to establish that \"NFL is a national organization\". Since the argument is not establishing that \"NFL is a national organization\" and true, it is not established that the argument is an attempt to establish that \"NFL is not allowed by federal law\" by establishing that \"NFL is a national organization\". So this is an attempt to establish the conclusion as false, when it is not.\n    9. Causal oversimplification : \"NFL is a national organization\". The conclusion is that \"NFL is a national organization\". \"NFL is a national organization\", and \"NFL is allowed by federal law\" are two premises that lead to the conclusion. Since the conclusion is true, it is not established that it is false to conclude that \"NFL is allowed by federal law\". So this is an attempt to establish the conclusion as false, when it is not.\n    10. Circular reasoning : \"NFL is a national organization\". The conclusion is that \"NFL is a national organization\". \"NFL is a national organization\" is a conclusion made about \"NFL\". Since the conclusion is false, it is not established that \"NFL is allowed by federal law\". So this is an attempt to establish the conclusion as false, when it is not.\n    11. Equivocation : \"NFL is a national organization\". The conclusion is that \"NFL is a national organization\". \"NFL is a national organization\" and \"NFL is an international organization\" are two premises that lead to the conclusion. Since the conclusion is false, it is not established that \"NFL is allowed by federal law\". So this is an attempt to establish the conclusion as false, when it is not.\n    12. Equivocation (cont'd) : \"NFL is a national organization\". The conclusion is that \"NFL is a national organization\". \"NFL is a national organization\" and \"NFL is a world organization\" are two premises that lead to the conclusion. Since the conclusion is true, it is not established that \"NFL is allowed by federal law\". So this is an attempt to establish the conclusion as false, when it is true.\n    13. False dilemma : \"NFL is a national organization\". The conclusion is that \"NFL is a national organization\". \"NFL is not a national organization\", and \"NFL is a world organization\" are two premises that lead to the conclusion. Since the conclusion is not established to be false by the premises, it is not established that \"NFL is allowed by federal law\". So this is an attempt to establish the conclusion as false, when it is not.\n    14. False dilemma (cont'd) : \"NFL is a national organization\". The conclusion is that \"NFL is a national organization\". \"NFL is a national organization\", and \"NFL is a world organization\" are two premises that lead to the conclusion. Since the conclusion is not established to be false by the premises, it is not established that \"NFL is not allowed by federal law\". So this is an attempt to establish the conclusion as false, when it is not.\n    15. False dilemma (cont'd) : \"NFL is a national organization\". The conclusion is that \"NFL is a national organization\". \"NFL is a national organization\", and \"NFL is a world organization\" are two premises that lead to the conclusion. Since the conclusion is not established to be false by the premises, it is not established that \"NFL is allowed by federal law\". So this is an attempt to establish the conclusion as false, when it is not.\n    16. Non-sequitur : \"NFL is a national organization\". The conclusion is that \"NFL is a national organization\". \"NFL is a national organization\", and \"NFL is a world organization\" are two premises that lead to the conclusion. Since the conclusion is not established by the premises, it is not established that \"NFL is allowed by federal law\". So this is an attempt to establish the conclusion as false, when it is not.\n    17. False analogy (cont'd) : \"NFL is a national organization\". The conclusion is that \"NFL is a national organization\". \"NFL is a national organization\", and \"NFL is a world organization\" are two premises that lead to the conclusion. Since the conclusion is not established by the premises, it is not established that \"NFL is allowed by federal law\". So this is an attempt to establish the conclusion as false, when it is true.\n    18. False analogy (cont'd) : \"NFL is a national organization\". The conclusion is that \"NFL is a national organization\". \"NFL is a national organization\", and \"NFL is a world organization\" are two premises that lead to the conclusion. Since the conclusion is not established by the premises, it is not established that \"NFL is not allowed by federal law\". So this is an attempt to establish the conclusion as false, when it is true.\n    19. False analogy (cont'd) : \"NFL is a national organization\". The conclusion is that \"NFL is a national organization\". \"NFL is a national organization\", and \"NFL is a world organization\" are two premises that lead to the conclusion. Since the conclusion is not established by the premises, it is not established that \"NFL is not allowed by federal law\". So this is an attempt to establish the conclusion as false, when it is true.\n\n\nI'm not an expert on the subject, but I'm a little confused by the logic here. The way I'm interpreting it, I think you're just trying to prove that your conclusion (NFL is a national organization) is logically valid and not a fallacy. Is that correct?\n\nI'm going to try to take a bit of a different tack, and attack it from a slightly different angle.\n\n\nI'm trying to see if any of the argument's premises are wrong. If a premise is false, the conclusion is false.\n\nSo I'm going to attack the conclusion's premises, and see if any of them are not true.\n\n(I'm going to attack the conclusion here, not the argument.)\n\n\nI'm going to attack the conclusion here, not the argument.\n\nArgument: NFL is a national organization\n\n(I'm going to attack \"NFL is a national organization\")\n\nConclusion: NFL is allowed by federal law\n\n\nI'm going to attack \"NFL is allowed by federal law\"\n\n(I'm going to attack \"NFL is allowed by federal law\")\n\nPremise: \"NFL is a national organization.\"\n\n\nPremise: \"NFL is a national organization.\"\n\n\nPremise: \"NFL is a national organization.\"\n\n\nPremise: \"NFL is a national organization.\"\n\n\nPremise: \"NFL is a national organization.\"\n\n\nPremise: \"NFL is a national organization.\"\n\n\nPremise: \"NFL is a national organization.\"\n\n\nPremise: \"NFL is a national organization.\"\n\n\nPremise: \"NFL is a national organization.\"\n\nPremise: \"NFL is a national organization.\"\n\nPremise: \"NFL is a national organization.\"\n\nPremise: \"NFL is a national organization.\"\n\n\nPremise: \"NFL is a national organization.\"\n\nPremise: \"NFL is a national organization.\"\n\n\nPremise: \"NFL is a national organization.\"\n\n\nPremise: \"NFL is a national organization.\"\n\n>>COMMENT<< I have an explanation that addresses your first point.

There are many different kinds of logic, each with its own rules and notations. We will focus on propositional logic, which is a logic of statements. This means we will focus on arguments with subject and predicate statements.\n\nA _propositional_ statement is a proposition, or a sentence, that can be analyzed to identify a _subject_ and a _predicate_ component. For example, the statement, \"All bachelors are unmarried\" identifies the subject _bachelors_ and the predicate _are_.\n\n## <a id=\"sentence_and_proposition\" name=\"sentence_and_proposition\"></a>Sentence and Proposition\n\nA _sentence_ is a complete statement. It can have more than one subject (a _multisubject_ or _polysubject_ statement), but it can have only one predicate (a _monopredic_ statement).\n\nWe will often use the term _proposition_ for the subject/predicate parts of a sentence.\n\n## <a id=\"propositional_logic\" name=\"propositional_logic\"></a>Propositional Logic\n\nPropositional logic is a branch of logic that studies arguments that can be expressed as statements with subjects and predicates. Propositional logic statements (also called _propositions_ ) must be _valid_ or _true_ to be considered correct.\n\n#### <a id=\"rule_of_modus_proprio\" name=\"rule_of_modus_proprio\"></a>Rule of Modus Ponens\n\nOne of the most important rules in propositional logic is the _rule of modus ponens_. This rule says that if an argument is valid, then the conclusion of the argument follows from the premises of the argument.\n\n##### <a id=\"example_rule_of_modus_proprio\" name=\"example_rule_of_modus_proprio\"></a>Example: Rule of Modus Ponens\n\nConsider the following argument:\n\n```\nAll spiders are poisonous.\nAll spiders bite.\nTherefore, all poisonous spiders bite.\n```\n\nWe can represent this argument using a truth table.\n\n| _True_ (Yes) | _False_ (No) | _Predicate_ | _Subject_ | _Conclusion_ |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| _All spiders are poisonous_ | _All poisonous spiders bite_ | _Poisonous_ | _Spider_ | _Bite_ |\n\n##### <a id=\"conclusion\" name=\"conclusion\"></a>Conclusion\n\nThe first statement is _true_ (yes or 1), the second statement is _false_ (no or 0), and the conclusion of the argument is _true_ (1).\n\nThe table shows that the conclusion is valid. That is, the argument is valid and the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\n##### <a id=\"example_rule_of_modus_tribuen\" name=\"example_rule_of_modus_tribuen\"></a>Example: Rule of Modus

if it was possible to identify fallacious arguments automatically with RASA. It's not very fast or accurate since I only used the available resources and I had to run it many times for it to learn. If someone were to refine this, it could be much faster and more accurate.\n\nEdit: I just realized this comment is very long and I haven't even gotten to the reason I wrote all of this. It's really hard to find people who are passionate enough about arguments to discuss them with me without becoming toxic. I really wish there were a community where we could talk about the fallacies we hear in everyday life. I feel like it would be a great way to improve your critical thinking skills.\n\nI'm still pretty new to machine learning and programming in general. I'm not sure if I can improve on this prototype or make it faster or more accurate, but I think it's a great starting point.>>COMMENT<< \nThe problem I see with this is that, if you really think about it, it doesn't actually have that much to do with what fallacies are.\n\nYou can take the argument \"All Catholics are pedophiles\" and turn it around as follows:\n\n\"All pedophiles are Catholics\"\n\nThe only difference in meaning between the two arguments is the direction of the causality. \"Catholics are pedophiles\" can be true, or it can be false. But if you say \"Catholics are pedophiles\" and then turn it around as \"All pedophiles are Catholics\", it's not even a true statement.\n\nBut if we look at some of the other fallacies here, that's not really what they're about:\n\n\"The best argument is a good argument.\"\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Because it's not a fallacy. The premise \"All Catholics are pedophiles\" is a true statement, and the conclusion \"Catholics are the best argument\" is true as well. In terms of fallacies, it's not a fallacy at all.\n\nIn terms of truth, it's not true. It's a true statement that has been turned around. But it's not a fallacy.\n\nIn terms of relevance, it's a bit tricky, but it's true that the argument \"Catholics are pedophiles\" is a good argument for the proposition \"Catholics are the best argument\", but it's also true that the argument \"Catholics are pedophiles\" is a good argument for the proposition \"Catholics are the best argument\". So it's not even a fallacy in terms of relevance.\n\nIt's really hard to find good examples of what I'm talking about, but I feel like there's one example that's pretty clear, and that's the \"All women are bad drivers\" argument. This is a true statement, but it's also true that \"All women are bad drivers\" is a false statement. So \"All women are bad drivers\" is not a fallacy, but it's not a good argument either.\n\nI hope you can understand what I'm trying to say here. I think it might be a bit tricky to understand, but I'm trying to get my point across.>>COMMENT<< \nYes, I agree with your reasoning here. My argument is that it's possible to tell if the argument is a fallacy or not based on how it is turned around. \n\nThe argument \"All women are bad drivers\" is false because women can be good drivers. This is because it's possible to have multiple true statements in an argument.\n\nThe argument \"Some women are bad drivers\" is true because women can be bad drivers. This is because it's possible to have multiple true statements in an argument.\n\nThe argument \"Some women are good drivers\" is false because some women can be bad drivers. This is because it's not possible to have multiple true statements in an argument.\n\nThe argument \"All women are bad drivers\" is false because it's not possible to have multiple true statements in an argument. The argument is also false because some women are good drivers. The argument is also false because \"All women are bad drivers\" is a true statement.\n\nSo, based on what I've said above, it's possible to tell if an argument is a fallacy or not based on how it is turned around.>>COMMENT<< \nYes, that's exactly what I was saying.\n\nThe argument \"Catholicism is bad\" can be false because some Catholics are good. But the argument \"Catholics are pedophiles\" can't be false because pedophiles are Catholic. So even if you turn it around as \"Catholics are pedophiles\" it's still true.\n\nIf an argument is true, you can't just say that it's false because it's been turned around. That's the fallacy fallacy.>>COMMENT<< I'm not sure if this is what you meant, but I think I'm starting to understand what you're saying. You're saying that it's possible to tell if an argument is a fallacy or not based on how it is turned around.\n\nBut if that's the case, it seems like your example of \"All women are bad drivers\" is kind of a special case. Because I think you're saying that it's possible to tell if an argument is a fallacy or not based on how it is turned around. So for other arguments, it's not always going to be possible to tell based on how it is turned around.>>COMMENT<< The point I'm trying to make is that you can't just say \"The argument is a fallacy\", because it's not always a fallacy.\n\nIf it's a true statement that has been turned around, it can't be a fallacy. It can be bad reasoning, but that's not the same as a fallacy.>>COMMENT<< This is what I wrote in the post:\n\n&gt; The potential types of fallacy include:>>COMMENT<< I'm sorry, but I don't think I understand what you're trying to tell me here. Could you please explain it again?>>COMMENT<< It seems like you're saying that it's possible to tell if an argument is a fallacy or not based on how it is turned around. But it's not always possible to tell if an argument is a fallacy or not.>>COMMENT<< I think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying. I'm not saying that it's always possible to tell if an argument is a fallacy or not. I'm saying that it's possible to tell if an argument is a fallacy or not based on how it is turned around.\n\nHere's another example: \"All Catholics are pedophiles\" can be false because it's not possible to have multiple true statements in an argument.\n\nNow let's turn that around: \"All pedophiles are Catholics\" can be true, but it's also true that \"All Catholics are pedophiles\" is false. So \"All pedophiles are Catholics\" can be true, but \"All Catholics are pedophiles\" is false.\n\nYou're saying that it's possible to tell if an argument is a fallacy or not based on how it is turned around. But it's not always possible to tell.\n\nIt's similar to the example I gave in the other comment. There is no logical or fallacy that would have made it true, so it's impossible to tell if the argument \"All Catholics are pedophiles\" is a fallacy or not. And if it can't be a fallacy, then you can't say that it's a fallacy.>>COMMENT<< Ah, I see what you mean now. I think that if an argument is a fallacy or not can be determined by how it is turned around.

I like how the artifact was more simple, I didnt like how it wasnt really that much more special than say a 5 ilvl upgrade. I like the order halls, they gave some story and werent super time consuming. I like how it felt less grindy than bfa. I like how it had some fun dungeons even though a few of them were pretty bad. I like how it had some fun raids. I like how it had some fun battlegrounds. I like how it had fun class abilities. I also liked the transmog changes. The only thing I dont like about legion is how it doesnt feel like we are getting a new expac. Everything feels like a copy paste from the last one, even the story feels like it was taken from the last one. I also dont like that you still have to go to dalaran to do everything, and that dalaran looks the same as its ever been. The only thing I dont like about it is the same thing I dont like about bfa and thats that it doesnt feel like a new expac. I think legion was the best one weve gotten, but if they wanna have another new expac, they need to try harder than this.\"\n    \n    Based on the above text, determine whether the following sentence is part of a fallacious argument or not.

Olive oil is healthy even though it has calories and fruit is healthy even though it has carbs. Dairy and red meat are fine - people have been consuming them for centuries and they did shit like building pyramids using just their hands. You don't need to live off of bland chicken breasts, broccoli, and scrambled eggs to be healthy. Also people need to learn the difference between added sugar and natural sugar.
