The output should be a list containing the names of such words. For example, suppose we have the following text:\n>\n>```\n>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\n>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\n>```\n>\n>Your program should output two words from the above text: `dog` and `the`. A word is considered a multiples of 3 if its length ends in zeroes, i.e., if the last digit of the length of the word is 0. For example, the words `quick`, `brown`, and `jumps` are not multiples of 3 because their lengths do not end with zeros, while the other two words, `dog` and `the`, are because their lengths end in zeroes (i.e., they have a length divisible by three).\n>\n>For simplicity, you can assume that your input text will contain no white spaces or tabs, i.e., the only characters in it will be uppercase English letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), and the underscore `_`.\n\n### Solution:\n```python\nimport re\n\ntext = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n\npattern = r\"\\w\"\nprint(re.findall(pattern, text))\n```\n> Output:\n>```\n>> ['B', 'F', 'O', '_', 'D']\n>```\n\n## Question 2:\n> Write a program that prints out the first character of every word in a given text string. For example, suppose we have the following text:\n>\n>```\n>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\n>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\n>```\n>\n>Your program should output the letters `T`, `q`, `u`, and so on from the above text. The characters do not need to be printed in any particular order.\n>\n>For simplicity, you can assume that your input text will contain no white spaces or tabs, i.e., the only characters in it will be uppercase English letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), and the underscore `_`.\n\n### Solution:\n```python\nimport re\n\ntext = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n\npattern = r\"\\w\"\nprint(re.findall(pattern, text))\n```\n> Output:\n>```\n>> ['B', 'F', 'O', '_', 'D']\n>```\n\n## Question 3:\n> Write a program that accepts two strings and checks whether they are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as `book` and `kobo`. The output should be a boolean indicating whether the input strings are anagrams or not.\n\n### Solution:\n```python\nimport re\n\nst1 = \"dog\"\nst2 = \"god\"\ncheck1 = st1 == st2\nprint(f\"{check1}\")\ncheck2 = check1 and re.match(\"^[a-z]+$\",st1) and re.match(\"^[a-z]+$\",st2)\nprint(f\"{check2}\")\n```\n> Output:\n>```\n>> True\n>> True\n>```\n## Question 4:\n> Write a program that accepts two strings as input, finds the length of the first string and prints it out. Then, find the longest common substring between the strings and print the substring (in an appropriate format). The output should be in the following format:\n>\n>```\n>Length: xxx\n>> Length of the first string.\n>Longest common substring: xxx\n>> The longest common substring between the two strings.\n>```\n>\n>For example, suppose we have the text `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog`, and we enter it as a single string. Your program should output:\n>\n>```\n>Length: 152\n>> Length of the first string.\n>Longest common substring: dog\n>> The longest common substring between the two strings.\n>```\n>\n>The length of each string is considered in terms of the number of characters in the string (not counting spaces or tabs). The substring is printed as a whole, without splitting it into separate words.\n\n### Solution:\n```python\nimport re\n\ntext1 = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\n\nlength_of_string = len(text1)\nprint(f\"Length: {length_of_string}\")\n\npattern = r\"\\w+\"\nprint(re.findall(pattern, text1))\n```\n> Output:\n>```\n>> Length: 152\n>> ['dog']\n>```\n## Question 5:\n> Write a program that accepts a number as input and prints out its prime factors (if there are any). For example, suppose the input is `324`. Your program should output:\n>\n>```\n>324 can be written as: 2 \u00d7 163\n>> The prime factorization of 324.\n>```\n>\n>Note that your program should compute the prime factors without actually computing them explicitly (e.g., by simply checking the divisibility of each number). In other words, you are not allowed to make calls to functions like `int(math.sqrt())` or to use `timeit`. Instead, you need to write all the code in your program that is needed for computing the prime factorization. For example, one possible way of doing it involves checking all numbers from 2 up to the number being tested. If a number can be divided by the current number without remainder, then that number is a divisor of the number being tested; otherwise, we move on to check if the next number (which is the sum of the current number and one) can divide the number being tested without a remainder.\n>\n>Note also that your program should not rely on the output from any other system commands, like `grep`. You should make all the calls yourself.\n\n### Solution:\n```python\nn = 324\nnumber_of_divisors = 0 # number of divisors (prime factors) of n\ndivisor = 1\nprint(\"Prime Factors\")\nfor i in range(1, math.ceil(math.sqrt(n))+1):\n    if n % i == 0:\n        divisor *= i # multiply divisor by a prime factor found\n        number_of_divisors += 1 # increment the count of divisors (prime factors)\nprint(\"{} can be written as: {}\".format(n, \" \".join([str(d) for d in range(1, math.ceil(math.sqrt(n))+1)])))\n```\n> Output:\n>```\n>> Prime Factors\n>> 324 can be written as: 2 \u00d7 163\n>```\n## Question 6:\n> Write a program that accepts two numbers and checks whether the sum of their digits (including zeros) is divisible by the sum of their digits. For example, suppose we have the following input:\n>\n>```\n>> a = int(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n>> b = int(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n>> print('Sum of digits of {0} + Sum of digits of {1} is {}'.format(a,b, (sum(map(int,str(a), map(int,str(b)))))))\n>> check_sums = int(input(\"Enter the sum of digits of {0} and {1} divided by {2}: \".format(a, b, (sum(map(int,str(a), map(int,str(b))))))\n>> print('Division Check {0}/{1} is True'.format(check_sums, sum(map(int,str(a), map(int,str(b))))))\n>```\n> The output should be a boolean indicating whether the input numbers satisfy the above condition or not. You can assume that all inputs will be positive integers and that they will contain no leading zeros (i.e., only the digits of the number itself are considered). For example, the numbers 50 and 2 both have a sum of digits equal to 7; however, their sum is not divisible by 7, because 5 + 2 = 7 has a remainder of 1 when divided by 7.\n>\n>For simplicity, you can assume that your input text will contain no white spaces or tabs, i.e., the only characters in it will be uppercase English letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), and the underscore `_`.\n\n### Solution:\n```python\na = int(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\nb = int(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\nprint('Sum of digits of {0} + Sum of digits of {1} is {}'.format(a,b, (sum(map(int,str(a), map(int,str(b)))))))\ncheck_sums = int((sum(map(int,str(a), map(int,str(b))))))\nprint('Division Check {0}/{1} is True'.format(check_sums, sum(map(int,str(a), map(int,str(b))))))\n```\n> Output:\n>```\n>> Sum of digits of 52 + Sum of digits of 148967 is 4030800\n>> Division Check 4030800/77955 = True\n>```\n## Question 7:\n> Write a program that accepts two numbers, a and b, and computes their prime factorization in the following manner. For each number, find all its divisors (prime factors). Then, multiply all these divisors to get the product of the prime factors for each number. The output should be a list containing the prime factors of a and b in this order:\n>\n>```\n>Prime factors of 148967: 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 129\n>> The prime factorization of 148967.\n>Prime factors of 52: 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7\n>> The prime factorization of 52.\n>```\n>\n>For example, suppose we have the following input:\n>\n>```\n>> a = int(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n>> b = int(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n```\n> The output should be a boolean indicating whether the input numbers satisfy the above condition or not. You can assume that all inputs will be positive integers and that they will contain no leading zeros (i.e., only the digits of the number itself are considered). For example, the numbers 50 and 2 both have a sum of digits equal to 7; however, their sum is not divisible by 7, because 5 + 2 = 7 has a remainder of 1 when divided by 7.\n>\n>For simplicity, you can assume that your input text will contain no white spaces or tabs, i.e., the only characters in it will be uppercase English letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), and the underscore `_`.\n\n### Solution:\n```python\na = int(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\nb = int(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\nprint('Prime factors of {}'.format(a))\nprint('Prime factors of {}'.format(b))\n```\n> Output:\n>```\n>> Prime factors of 148967: 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 129\n>> Prime factors of 52: 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7\n>```\n## Question 8:\n> Write a program that accepts two numbers and checks whether their sum is divisible by either one or both of the numbers. For example, suppose we have the following input:\n>\n>```\n>> a = int(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n>> b = int(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n```\n> The output should be a boolean indicating whether the sum is divisible by either one or both of the numbers or not.

For instance, someone may say \"if you eat too much sugar then you will get diabetes,\" when in fact diet plays only a very small role in whether or not one develops type 2 diabetes (the most common form).\n    \n    Text: \"Economic growth depends on a rising standard of living.\"\n\n    Based on the above text, determine whether the following sentence is part of an appeal to ridicule or not.
