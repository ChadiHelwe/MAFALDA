The masks do little. Cool it. Once they wear masks your anxiety will force you to demand the next step. biohazard suits? get real.\n"}

The left is asking for expanding background checks, closing the gun show loop hole, maybe registering firearms and creating a system that addresses or catches strawman purchases. We don't need to play this strawman argument game. And we don't need to do the\"slippery slope\" thing either. Reasonable regulations doesn't lead to the fed keeping lists and someday coming after all gun owners to suppress the working class.\n"}
{"text": "TITLE: NFL Player wants NFL to consider permitting marijuana use for pain management\r\nPOST: question, both medical marijuana and adderall are both banned NFL substances. Adderall is allowed with a prescription, so why wouldn't medical marijuana be allowed with a prescription if a player is in a state where medical marijuana is legal? edit. /u/btbrian makes a great point. \"For one thing, it would inherently give players in states where it is legal an edge if it does have performance related (pain management) effects like they claim\"\r\nPOST: NFL is a national organization and most likely follow federal laws. Lots of companies in green states don't allow marijuana use because of that or because they can still just make it their policy"}

This and banning plastic straws are the issues we need to solve to create a better life and society for people. I'm so glad CA is at the forefront of tackling our nation's most pressing issues. Keep being a beacon of hope CA and I'm sure other states will follow.\n"}

Off the top of my head legiondaries were pretty bad bc it took so long to be able to target them. I remember getting the one I wanted for a character about a week before BFA dropped and not really being able to use it. Also was never really a fan of the AP grind tho I did love having my weapon always guaranteed. Order halls were also super hit or miss for me and I hated the rogue one. Spent most of my time in the Maelstrom and I liked it tho.\r\nPOST: i think people focus too much on legendary acquisition and forgot how good the other parts of the xpac were. there werent many complaints at all except for legendary acquisition"}

{"text": "TITLE: What\"healthy\" food is actually way more unhealthy than most people think? POST: Incoming comments of things that are nutritious but people don't consider healthy because they're high in calories AND other random shit they read on a blog who's ultimate goal is to convince them to spend money on something at some point. Olive oil is healthy even though it has calories and fruit is healthy even though it has carbs. Dairy and red meat are fine - people have been consuming them for centuries and they did shit like building pyramids using just their hands. You don't need to live off of bland chicken breasts, broccoli, and scrambled eggs to be healthy. Also people need to learn the difference between added sugar and natural sugar. The sugar in fruit is not the same sugar in candy bars. I think one of the biggest reasons for the obesity epidemic in America is the over-complication of nutrition. A new food is\"unhealthy\" every week.\n"}
{"text": "TITLE: In mid-December, a model from the CA government predicted 75K COVID hospitalizations by mid-January, steep growth from the 16K then hospitalized. Yesterday, CA had less than 21K COVID hospitalizations.\r\nPOST: In all honesty have we seen one single Covid related model turn out to be correct or even close in the past 10 months?\r\nPOST: Every one I remember seeing has proven itself to be between 50% and 90% overstated. Our death counts ended up being 10% of what the models were forecasting. One of the cities here went from three overflow hospitals to finding locations for one back in April, then only building a permanent one which has never been staffed. They claim they don't have the personnel to staff them....despite the state's NG being given authorization from our governor to send its stock of nurses and doctors to do it. It makes me wonder of it was just the usual bureaucratic waste or if they've got a future use in mind for the facility..."}
