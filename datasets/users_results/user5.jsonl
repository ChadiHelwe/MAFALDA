{"id":4727,"text":"TITLE: NFL Player wants NFL to consider permitting marijuana use for pain management\r\nPOST: question, both medical marijuana and adderall are both banned NFL substances. Adderall is allowed with a prescription, so why wouldn't medical marijuana be allowed with a prescription if a player is in a state where medical marijuana is legal? edit. \/u\/btbrian makes a great point. \"For one thing, it would inherently give players in states where it is legal an edge if it does have performance related (pain management) effects like they claim\"\r\nPOST: NFL is a national organization and most likely follow federal laws.

POST: Incoming comments of things that are nutritious but people don't consider healthy because they're high in calories AND other random shit they read on a blog who's ultimate goal is to convince them to spend money on something at some point. Olive oil is healthy even though it has calories and fruit is healthy even though it has carbs. Dairy and red meat are fine - people have been consuming them for centuries and they did shit like building pyramids using just their hands. You don't need to live off of bland chicken breasts, broccoli, and scrambled eggs to be healthy. Also people need to learn the difference between added sugar and natural sugar. The sugar in fruit is not the same sugar in candy bars. I think one of the biggest reasons for the obesity epidemic in America is the over-complication of nutrition. A new food is\"unhealthy\" every week.\n","label":[[206,326,"Appeal to Ridicule"],[453,563,"ad populum"],[453,563,"appeal to tradition"],[453,563,"causal oversimplification"]],"Comments":[]}
